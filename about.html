          <p id="para1" class="about__chef--para">Two years ago, I was a chef who enjoyed creating something physically and felt satisfaction in customers savouring what I have created. But at some point in time, I noticed myself spending a lot more hours sitting on a chair, and browsing the web, fascinated by all contents related to the latest technology. A strong curiosity kicked inside my head regarding what it takes to become a software developer. </p>

          <p id="para2" class="about__journey--para">My new journey began with the recent COVID-19 pandemic, a period that would be remembered as the most atrocious and disastrous for many people. Having no prior knowledge about the industry, I started studying for the AWS Solutions Architect Associate Certificate on Udemy following the current trends on cloud systems. With firm motivation and effort, I was able to obtain the certification within a few monthsâ€™ time. My pursuit for a career in technology did not stop there as I received the opportunity to participate in the 12-weeks software developer training program conducted by the _nology. </p>
